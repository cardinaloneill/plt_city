<![CDATA[<HEADERBLUE>Headsets and Driving: Common Sense Safety</HEADERBLUE>
<p>Tips for keeping both hands on the wheel and two eyes on the road with your mobile phone and headset.</p>

<HEADERBLUE>1. Trial Run</HEADERBLUE>
<p>Practice using your phone and headset together before you drive. Familiarize yourself with the headset controls. Adjust the fit and the microphone on your headset, check the headset settings on your cell phone and stow the phone so it's out of your way but still accessible.</p>
<HEADERBLUE>2. Be Prepared</HEADERBLUE>
<p>Program all your frequently called numbers into your phone. This includes your boss, your kids' babysitter and your favorite neighborhood pizza place. And don't forget about voice dialing; most phones have that option, so use it as much as possible.</p>
<HEADERBLUE>3. Set Up For Success</HEADERBLUE>
<p>Just as you check your rearview mirror and secure your seatbelt before driving, be sure to put your headset on and ensure it's connected properly to your phone.</p>
<HEADERBLUE>4. Driving Comes First</HEADERBLUE>
<p>Remember: your first priority is driving. You should only place and receive calls when it's absolutely necessary.</p>
<HEADERBLUE>5. Comfort is King</HEADERBLUE>
<p>Heads and ears come in all shapes and sizes, so what fits your friend may not fit you. Fortunately, Plantronics has developed countless options to fit just about anyone.</p>
<p>Plantronics recognizes that there are occasions when driving circumstances make talking on a mobile phone - handheld or hands-free - unsafe. In these instances, motorists should pull over or hang up to protect the safety of themselves, their passengers and others on the road.</p>
